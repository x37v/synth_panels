Color [from creature manual]:
black  - Black—Bi-polar AC-coupled voltages and signal (voltages that may swing between positive and negative, as in an audio signal) 
blue   - Blue—Unipolar DC-coupled voltages (usually positive-only control voltages) 
red    - Red—Logic (triggers, gates, and other positive-going pulses) 
violet - Violet—Synchronization , currently found only on voltage-controlled oscillators so that one master oscillator may “retrigger’ the waveforms of slave oscillators and help eliminate unwanted “beat frequencies.”
